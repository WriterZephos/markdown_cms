# Demo Content Book

This a demo of MarkdownRecord.

The content seen here represents a book of some kind. The Book model defined in this content has a `has_many` association to Chapters and Illustrations, as follows:

```ruby
  class Book < ::MarkdownRecord::Base
    attribute :name

    has_many_content :chapters
    has_many_content :illustrations
  end
```

Of course, this is a contrived example for testing/demo purposes only. It is intended to show how you can define as many models of various types in your source markdown files, and then define their relationships independently using your ruby models.

Please see the README for a detailed guide on how to use MarkdownRecord.
