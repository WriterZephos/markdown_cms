# MarkdownRecord

Welcome to MarkdownRecord! This document will walk you through the many powerful features of MarkdownRecord. After installing the engine you should have this document as well as three other subdirectories in your `markdown_record/content` directory within your application root.

The three subdirectories are `api_docs`, `blog` and `table_top_game` which each contain an example use case for MarkdownRecord and demonstrate different features. The features the each example demonstrates are listed below.

## API Docs

  This example shows how you can write API documentation and define data to be queried about the API interface of an application, all in one place, without having to do anything outside your markdown files.
