# Controller Helpers

This section describes the controller helpers provided by MarkdownRecord to help interact with MarkdownRecord.

To use controller helpers in a controller, simply include the `MarkdownRecord::ControllerHelpers` module like so:

```ruby
include ::MarkdownRecord::ControllerHelpers
```

When the module is included, you will be able to call the following methods in your controller:

- `content_fragment`: finds a content fragment based on a passed id. If no id is passed it looks for `params[:content_path]` instead.
- `render_html`: takes an optional content fragment and an optional layout, then renders the fragment as HTML. If no fragment is provided, it calls `content_fragment` to get it using `params[:content_path]`. If no layout is provided, it uses the public_layout configured for MarkdownRecord (by default this is the application layout).
- `render_json`: takes an optional content fragment and renders it as JSON. If no fragment is provided, it calls `content_fragment` to get it using `params[:content_path]`.
- `download_html`: same a `render_html` but renders a file for download.
- `download_json`: same a `render_json` but renders a file for download.
