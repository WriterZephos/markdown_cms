<h1>Demo Content Book</h1>

<p>This a demo of MarkdownRecord.</p>

<p>The content seen here represents a book of some kind. The Book model defined in this content has a <code>has_many</code> association to Chapters and Illustrations, as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">class Book &lt; ::MarkdownRecord::Base
  attribute :name

  has_many_content :chapters
  has_many_content :illustrations
end
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, this is a contrived example for testing/demo purposes only. It is intended to show how you can define as many models of various types in your source markdown files, and then define their relationships independently using your ruby models.</p>

<p>Please see the README for a detailed guide on how to use MarkdownRecord.</p>
